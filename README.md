## Description
In this project, I have created a simple todo-list command line in python

In this todo-list, you can add a todo, delete a todo, mark a todo as completed, list all todos and list all completed todos.

Let's see how it works in detail:
First run the application,then you will see a menu with 6 options:

1. Add a todo  
This option will ask you to enter a todo and will add it to the list of todos.
For example, let's suppose you have to do finish your project, you can add it.
2. Delete a todo  
This option will ask you to enter the number of the todo you want to delete and will delete it from the list of todos.  
For example, let's suppose that you add a todo but you named it wrongly, you can delete it. 
3. List all todos  
This option will list all the todos that are not completed yet.
Here, you can see a recap of all the todos you have to do.
4. Mark a todo as completed  
This option will ask you to enter the number of the todo you want to mark as completed and will mark it as completed.
Let's supposed that you have done your shopping, you can mark it as completed.
5. List all completed todos  
This option will list all the todos that are completed.
You will then see the shopping todo that you mark completed previously.
6. Exit  
This option will exit the program.

Moreover, the program will saves the todos in a file called "todos.txt" and will load them when you run the program.
This allows you to keep your todos even if you close the program.
